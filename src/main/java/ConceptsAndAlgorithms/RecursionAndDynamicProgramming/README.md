1.  A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.[ [one][101] ]
2. Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there fortherobottogofrom (0,0) to (X,Y)?
FOLLOW UP
Imagine certain spots are "off limits," such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.[ [two][102] ]
3. A magic index in an array A[0...n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in arrayA.
FOLLOW UP
What if the values are not distinct?[ [three][103] ]
4. Write a method to return all subsets of a set. [ [four][104] ]
5. Write a method to compute all permutations of a string. [ [five][105] ]
6. Implement an algorithm to print all valid (e.g., properly opened and closed) combinations of n-pairs of parenthesesRecursively.
   EXAMPLE
   Input: 3
   Output:((())), (()()), (())(), ()(()), ()()() [ [six][106] ]

7. Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color, fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color [ [seven][107] ]


8.  Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents. [ [eight][108] ]

9.  Write an algorithm to prim all ways of arranging eight queens on an 8x8 chess board so that none of them share the same row, column or diagonal. In this case, "diagonal" means all diagonals, not just the two that bisect the board. [ [nine][109] ]
