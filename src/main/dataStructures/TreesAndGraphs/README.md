2.  Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.[ [two][102] ]
3.  Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.[ [three][103] ]
4.  Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D,you'll have D linked list). [ [four][104] ]
5.  implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree. [ [five][105] ]
