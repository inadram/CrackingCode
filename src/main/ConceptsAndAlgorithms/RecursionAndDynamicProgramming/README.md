1.  A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.[ [one][101] ]
2. magine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there fortherobottogofrom (0,0) to (X,Y)?
FOLLOW UP
Imagine certain spots are "off limits," such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.[ [two][102] ]
3. A magic index in an array A[0...n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in arrayA.
FOLLOW UP
What if the values are not distinct?[ [three][103] ]
4. Write a method to return all subsets of a set. [ [four][104] ]
5. Write a method to compute all permutations of a string. [ [five][105] ]
6. Implement an algorithm to print all valid (e.g., properly opened and closed) combinations of n-pairs of parentheses.
   EXAMPLE
   Input: 3
   Output:((())), (()()), (())(), ()(()), ()()() [ [six][106] ]
