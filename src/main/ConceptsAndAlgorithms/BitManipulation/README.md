1.  You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j .
Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. 
You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. 
That is, if M= 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. 
You would not,for example, have j = 3 and i = 2,because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
EXAMPLE
Input: N=10000000000,M=10011,i=2,j=6 Output:N = 10001001100 [[one][101]]

2.  Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g.,0.72) that is passed in as a double,print the binary representation.
If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR."[[two][102]]
