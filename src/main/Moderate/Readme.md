1.  Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary variables). [[one][101]]
2.  Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe.[[two][102]]
3.  Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeros in n factorial.[[three][103]]
4.  Write a method which finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if-else or any other comparison operator.[[four][104]]
5.  TheCameof Master Mind isplayed asfollows:
    The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (Y), green (C) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (Slot # 1isred, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).
    You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. Youmight, for example, guess YRGB.
    When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit." If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit." Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit.
    For example,if the actual solution is RGBYandyou guess GGRR, you have one hit and onepseudo-hit.
    Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.[[five][105]]
